# Pokedex

Welcome to the Pokedex repository! This project is a Pokedex application designed to showcase my skills in manipulating APIs. It utilizes React for the frontend, Express.js and Node.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.

## Features

The Pokedex application includes the following features:
<ul>
<li>Pokemon List: View a list of Pokemon species with their names and corresponding images.</li>
<li>Pokemon Details: Click on a Pokemon to view detailed information, including types, abilities, and stats.</li>
<li>Pagination: Navigate through multiple pages of Pokemon.</li>
<li>API Integration: Utilize an external API to fetch Pokemon data and images.</li>
<li>Backend with Express.js and Node.js: Implement server-side functionality using Express.js and Node.js.</li>
<li>Database with MongoDB: Store and retrieve data from MongoDB for persistent storage.</li>
</ul>

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

|- client/               # Directory for the frontend code (React)<br/>
|  |- src/               # React components and frontend code<br/>
|  |- public/            # Public assets and index.html file<br/>
|- server/               # Directory for the server-side code (Express.js, Node.js)<br/>
|  |- routes/            # Server routes and API endpoints<br/>
|  |- models/            # Database models and schemas (MongoDB)<br/>
|- images/               # Directory for images used in the app<br/>
|- package.json          # Project dependencies and scripts<br/>
|- README.md             # README file<br/>
